# Python DDP

This project requires Python 3.7 or later. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

## Setting up a virtual environment

To set up a virtual environment for this project, run the following commands:

```
make venv
```

This will create a virtual environment in the `pytorch-ddp` directory.

## Installing dependencies

To install the required packages, make sure your virtual environment is activated, and run the following command:

```
make install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

## Using the virtual environment

To use the virtual environment, make sure it is activated by running the following command;

```
source pytorch-ddp/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can run the Pytorch scripts and use the packages installed in the virtual environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run the following command:

```
deactivate
```

That's it! You now have a virtual environment set up for this project, with all the necessary dependenciess installed. You can now run the Python scripts and start working on your project.
